The main objective of this project is to build classifiers to predict a sms as spam or not. 
I have created a function to remove stop words, tokenize and create a bigram model for the corpus.
Next I implemented various classifiers and achieved best accuracies with Decision Tree Classifier 
with cross validation score of around 95%.
